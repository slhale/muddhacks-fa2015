# MuddHacks, Fall 2015

We are making an LED counterclock using an Arduino MEGA and adafruit LED matrix. 

There are libraries given, but you need to copy them into your Arduino libraries folder for them to work. 
The LED libraries are from [adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) and [adafruit/RGB-matrix-Panel](https://github.com/adafruit/RGB-matrix-Panel). We're also using the [PaulStoffregen/Time](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time) time library.
